# Choreography

I think a category structure would be best for what we are working on, that being Association Football or better yet, Soccer. Things like time and alphabet could work as well, but I find that taking certain fundamental things that each city has would be ideal and make for easy understanding.

I think soccer teams that are that are most popular to least popular would be an effective idea (Hierachy framework). That way viewers of the site are introduced to the team in which they are more likely to be familiar with. Another way can be location closest to our Univeristy or something of that sort, but I find most of these countries [that the team resides in], I get the feeling that many people won't really know how far they are compared to the next team.

The content for soccer will be similarly displayed how it is in the **Taxonomy**. I want to show the team name with the country that the team is located in under it. Then follow that with a current team photo. And continue the trend within the **Taxonomy** for the rest of the content.
